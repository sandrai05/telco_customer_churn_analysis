# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis – Telecom Dashboard (Power BI)

A business-focused dashboard that analyzes **customer churn behavior** in the telecom industry to uncover **why customers leave** and which segments are most at risk. This project simulates how a data analyst might help reduce churn by uncovering patterns in service usage, contract types, and demographics.
